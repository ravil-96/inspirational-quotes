# Lap 1 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your first debugging assignment!
This repo is riddled with bugs and we need your help to fix it up.
Please make sure that you **read all the instructions before starting**.


## Code of Conduct
- Do not ask your classmates (verbally or through any other communication method) for help.
- Do not copy/paste any code from someone else or from any online resource.


## Tasks
You are going to debug and complete a Random Quotes generator. When you are finished with the app, it should look something like this:

### Server
-[] Install the node modules and get your api server running
-[] Use the comments in `app.js` to add the missing routes and improve the `/quotes/:index` route

### Client
-[]Edit title and button using CSS and HTML so that it looks like the one in the gif (don't worry about exact colour or font size). Feel free to use external fonts.
-[]Change the background image and add image credits in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.
-[]Clean up any repetitive or unneeded code
-[]Debug script.js so that a random quote is shown every time the button is clicked

_(You may restructure / add files as you deem necessary)_

### README
